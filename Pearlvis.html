	<h1>One Morning</h1>
	<h2><strong>Gregor Samsa</strong> woke
	 from troubled 
	dreams.</h2>

	<p>One morning, when <strong>Gregor Samsa</strong> woke from troubled
	dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into
	a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, 
	and if he lifted his head a little he could see his
    brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into
    stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover
    it and seemed ready to slide
    off any moment

    <p>His many legs, pitifully thin
    compared with the size of the rest of him, 
    waved about 
    helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me? "he
    thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human 
    room although a little too small, lay peacefully 
    between its four familair walls.</p>

    <p>One morning, when <strong>Gregor Samsa</strong> woke from troubled
    dreams.</p>

    <p>The bedding was hardly able to cover it.</p>

    It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur 
    boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that 
    covered the whole of her lower arm towards the
    viewer.
