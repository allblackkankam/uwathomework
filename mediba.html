	<h1>ONE MORNING</h1>

<h2><strong>Gregor Samsa</strong> woke from troubled 
dreams.</h2> 

<p>One morning, when <strong>Gregor Samsa</strong> woke from troubled 
dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into 
a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, 
and if he lifted his head a little he could see his 
brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into 
stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover 
it and seemed ready to slide 
off any moment.

His many legs, pitifully thin 
compared with the size of the rest of him, 
waved about 
helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me? " he 
thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human 
room although a little too small, lay peacefully 
between its four familiar walls.

One morning, when <strong>Gregor Samsa</strong> woke from troubled 
dreams.

The bedding was hardly able to cover it.

It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur 
boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that 
covered the whole of her lower arm towards the 
viewer.
